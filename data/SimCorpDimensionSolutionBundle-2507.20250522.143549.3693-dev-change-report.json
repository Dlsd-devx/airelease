It will therefore be the single leg that holds the entire P/L and return of the contract. There is, however, a conceptual problem with these methods, since the start of day market value on the value bearing leg is also zero. TWR is therefore not well defined on the opening date when using these price methods. The existing calculation applies a trick where the return is calculated on each leg and then simply subtracted from each other and put to the value bearing leg. One way to understand this approach is that it calculates a unitized P/L for each leg and moves these to the single leg. This approach is, however, difficult to understand and explain. On top of this, when the synthetic FX hedge returns are used in Investment Analytics Platform - Performance, they are always used on a synthetic FX forward that has two non-zero legs. This might not be the expected behavior if SCD is setup to calculate the returns using a price method that implicitly treats the FX forward as a single-legged instrument. Since these methods are not recommended from a performance perspective, they are removed as calculation options from the Synthetic FX Hedge Return Calculation Settings window. Instead, the four corresponding P/L price methods are added. These are recommended from a performance perspective since they have market value on both legs.","Products":["Performance"]},{"SimCorpReference":"S-186533","ChangeNote":"Adds Balance number of units to Position Calculation","Products":["Business-Risk","CsCode-MiddleOffice"]},{"SimCorpReference":"D-82090","ChangeNote":"Fix error, when CAM is not showing the elected position after Dividend transaction gets generated if the holding is based on the Opening balance","Products":["Business-CorporateActions"]},{"SimCorpReference":"S-187062","ChangeNote":"Changes in new AU CGT C# engine - no impact on clients.
