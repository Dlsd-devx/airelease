By too big it is meant above 2 times the smallest unit of the currency e.g. 0.02 for EUR or USD). This would cause the golden equation to fail for the corrected tax lot.\nSecondly reallocation values for Initial Premium and Discount values could become incorrect.\nThirdly if a tax lot had an incorrect value for Balance Initial Premium and Discount and was fully sold a check would be made which could cause Balance Initial Premium and Discount not to go to zero on the tax lot.\n\nWhat is the proposed solution?\nFirst the rounding check has been improved so a single lot will not get more than 2 times the smallest unit of the currency. Then later golden equation checks on individual tax lot level will be able to ensure that the golden equation holds per tax lot. As a consequence the rounding check for reallocations will affect more tax lots.\nSecondly a correction has been made to ensure correct reallocation values for Initial Premium and Discount values.\nThirdly a correction has been made so a check on Initial Premium and Discount values is not executed for fully sold tax lots.","Products":["Business-TransactionBookingAccounting","Business-TransactionGenerationAccounting"]},{"SimCorpReference":"S-177337","ChangeNote":"No code changes.
