This defect has been fixed. \n\nFor more details: The problem was when linked positions are calculated in the same chunk in the portfolio calculation on a given date, then overlapping agreement and payment dates of the transactions in position A can update the from-date for fetching transactions to an earlier date for this position A, but not for the other position B. This means that a potential linked transaction in position A is fetched based on the earlier from-date, but the corresponding linked transaction leg in position B based on the original from-date is NOT fetched. However, this linked transaction leg in position B will be fetched anyway later on. BUT any transactions booked between this linked transaction in position B and the original from-date were NOT fetched! Usually, this is not a problem, but for the settlement day adjusted PCL holding used to calculate accrued interest this can have an effect. The problem has been fixed by adjusting the from-date for fetching transactions of linked positions to the same from-date in PCL frameworks. Furthermore, only the linked positions of interest-bearing instrument types are considered.
